- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a clean and contemporary aesthetic; body text: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) to ensure excellent readability and a modern feel throughout the interface. 
- Use a consistent set of minimalist icons to represent different functions and data points within the app. These icons should be monochromatic and designed to be easily recognizable.
- Employ a responsive, grid-based layout that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile platforms.
- Implement subtle, non-intrusive transitions and animations to enhance user engagement and provide visual feedback, ensuring that interactions feel smooth and responsive.
